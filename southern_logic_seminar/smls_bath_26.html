<h2>
Venue
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in 3 East 2.1. Anyone arriving before lunchtime can find the local participants in the Department of Computer Science, on the fourth floor of 1 West. The <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf">campus map</a> might be helpful if you get lost.

Travel bursaries
</h2>

<p>
Each meeting has a small budget to cover travel costs for speakers and participants. Priority will be given to young researchers, particularly PhD students. We are also able to provide some support for participants with caring or parenting responsibilities. Anyone who requires support should contact <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">Thomas Powell</a> in advance of the meeting.

<p>
<b>"To contract, or to delete, that is the question" Gecia Bravo-Hermsdorff, Bath</b><br>
The analogy between graphs and electrical circuits has played a fundamental role in the development of graph theory, and its myriad connections to other branches of mathematics and science.  The discrete graph Laplacian, an operator related to diffusion on graphs, and the effective resistance are two major players in this story.  I will introduce you to these characters by describing how we used them to make a graph reduction algorithm that preserves global structure while reducing it via the dual operations of edge deletion and contraction.  This will lead us to a surprising connection with the Tutte polynomial, a fundamental combinatorial invariant with deep connections to a wide range of other topics.

<b>"Dependent Monads" Till Rampe, Birmingham</b><br>
In this talk, we will understand monads as representing algebraic theories using the language of category theory.
We will tie together two concepts from the theory of monads. On the one hand, there is the monad of monads, whose algebras (also known as left modules) are monads. On the other hand, some monads depend on an algebra of another monad. Consider, for instance, the monad of free R-modules: it is indexed by an algebra R of the free ring monad.
To relate these two notions, we will recall so-called bimodules between monads and then prove a correspondence between bimodules into the monad of monads and dependent monads.

<b>"A Logic for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems" Hamza Bandukara, Queen Mary</b><br>
We introduce a Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems (FLTSs). These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can model fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn can be seen as a "regular" class of history-tracking automata operating on infinite input alphabets. The logic we introduce is a modal mu-calculus equipped with infinite disjunctions over arbitrary and fresh data values respectively, while its recursion is parameterised on vectors of data values. It can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values, the absence of paths where values are repeated, or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated. We study the model checking problem and its complexity via a reduction to parity games and, using nominal sets techniques, provide an exponential upper bound for it.

<b>"Double negation elimination and the multiple succedent structure of LK" Nox Cowie, Sussex</b><br>
The classical natural deduction system NK can be obtained from the intuitionistic
system NJ by adding a double negation elimination inference rule. On the other hand,
the intuitionistic and classical sequent calculi LJ and LK are differentiated not by
the addition of a rule, but by the number of formulae that can be contained in the
right-hand side of a sequent. In an LJ-derivation, the right-hand side of a sequent can
contain at most one formula; the classical LK is obtained by lifting this restriction.
This distinction between LJ and LK is of a notably different nature than that between
NJ and NK: the first being purely structural, and the second involving the explicit
addition of a classical inference pattern. We demonstrate how the classical strength of
double negation elimination emerges from the structural feature of right multiplicity
by examining the relationship between derivations in natural deduction and sequent
calculus and, in particular, applications of their respective implication and negation
inference rules. As a result, we clarify how right multiplicity constitutes a counterpart
to the principle of double negation elimination.

<b>"Tropical homotopies two ways" Yue Ren, Durham</b><br>
This talk revolves around the efficient computation of the solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  We will recap methods from the current state of the art, the maths behind them and their limitations. We will then give an introduction to tropical geometry, outline how it can help us push beyond it, and which theoretical and practical challenges need to be overcome.
