<h2>
Venue
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in 3 East 2.1. Anyone arriving before lunchtime can find the local participants in the Department of Computer Science, on the fourth floor of 1 West. The <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf">campus map</a> might be helpful if you get lost.

<h2>
Travel bursaries
</h2>

<p>
Each meeting has a small budget to cover travel costs for speakers and participants. Priority will be given to young researchers, particularly PhD students. We are also able to provide some support for participants with caring or parenting responsibilities. Anyone who requires support should contact <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">Thomas Powell</a> in advance of the meeting.

<p>
<b>"A Logic for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems" Hamza Bandukara, Queen Mary</b><br>
We introduce a Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems (FLTSs). These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can model fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn can be seen as a "regular" class of history-tracking automata operating on infinite input alphabets. The logic we introduce is a modal mu-calculus equipped with infinite disjunctions over arbitrary and fresh data values respectively, while its recursion is parameterised on vectors of data values. It can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values, the absence of paths where values are repeated, or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated. We study the model checking problem and its complexity via a reduction to parity games and, using nominal sets techniques, provide an exponential upper bound for it.

<b>"Double negation elimination and the multiple succedent structure of LK" Nox Cowie, Sussex</b><br>
The classical natural deduction system NK can be obtained from the intuitionistic
system NJ by adding a double negation elimination inference rule. On the other hand,
the intuitionistic and classical sequent calculi LJ and LK are differentiated not by
the addition of a rule, but by the number of formulae that can be contained in the
right-hand side of a sequent. In an LJ-derivation, the right-hand side of a sequent can
contain at most one formula; the classical LK is obtained by lifting this restriction.
This distinction between LJ and LK is of a notably different nature than that between
NJ and NK: the first being purely structural, and the second involving the explicit
addition of a classical inference pattern. We demonstrate how the classical strength of
double negation elimination emerges from the structural feature of right multiplicity
by examining the relationship between derivations in natural deduction and sequent
calculus and, in particular, applications of their respective implication and negation
inference rules. As a result, we clarify how right multiplicity constitutes a counterpart
to the principle of double negation elimination.
