<h1>
SOUTHERN AND MIDLANDS LOGIC SEMINAR
</h1>

  <p>
The Southern and Midlands Logic Seminar aims to bring together researchers from groups situated in the lower half of England and Wales who share an interest in both mathematical logic (particularly proof theory, type theory, category theory and complexity) and its application in the theory of
programming languages and verification.
  </p>

  <p>
The seminar is now in its second academic year, and is a partnership between Bath, Birmingham, Oxford and UCL. Meetings in 2023/24 will be held at these universities, but will involve invited speakers and encourage participation from other institutions in the area. We are generously supported by the London Mathematical Society through their <a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/joint-research-groups-uk-scheme-3">Joint Research Groups</a> scheme, and receive additional support from the host institutions. 
  </p>

<p>
The seminar could be viewed as a spiritual successor to the <a href="https://wiki.bath.ac.uk/display/wessex/Wessex+Theory+Seminar">Wessex Theory Seminar</a>, which ran from 2008 until 2013.
 </p>

Travel bursaries
</h2>

<p>
Each meeting has a small budget to cover travel costs for speakers and participants. Priority will be given to young researchers, particularly PhD students. We are also able to provide some support for participants with caring or parenting responsibilities. Anyone who requires support should contact <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">Thomas Powell</a> in advance of the meeting.
