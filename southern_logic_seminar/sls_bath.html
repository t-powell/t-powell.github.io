Venue
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station, and is also connected to the city via the U1 bus. Further details on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in 5 West 2.4, which is located in the Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. Anyone arriving before lunchtime can find the local participants in the Department of Computer Science, on the fourth floor of 1 West.

<b>"Algebraic structures in relational semantics" <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/gam23/">Guy McCusker</a>, University of Bath</b><br>
The well-known relational semantics of linear logic is constructed out of two kinds of free algebra construction: the powerset and the set of finite multisets of a set. This model occupies a central position in denotational semantics. It can interpret typed and untyped lambda-calculus, and is closely related to non-idempotent intersection type systems. In this talk weâ€™ll explore what happens when one varies the algebraic constructions used to build the model. After reviewing some already-known models which arise through the use of different free constructions, we will investigate a new model which is obtained by considering algebras other than the free ones.

<b>"String diagrams for layered structures" <a href="https://leolob.ski/">Leo Lobski</a>, University College London</b><br>
It is customary to think that descriptions of the material reality by different sciences form "layers of abstraction": chemistry is more high-level than physics, biology more high-level than chemistry and so on. We introduce layered props: a diagrammatic framework that is able to handle situations with multiple levels of description, as well as translations between them. To motivate the formalism, we express two examples of scientific modelling as layered props: electrical circuits and retrosynthetic analysis in chemistry. We conclude by showing that the syntactic description of a layered prop can be interpreted naturally as a certain subcategory of pointed profunctors.

<p>
<b>"Kripke vs. categorical semantics for modal logic" <a href="https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~tz20861/">Alex Kavvos</a>, University of Bristol</b><br>
Over the past 30 years there have been multiple attempts at formulating proof systems for intuitionistic modal logics, with attendant categorical semantics. On the other hand, over the last 60 years there has been a parallel development of Kripke semantics for modal logic, which also admit intuitionistic variations. We retrace our steps, and show that the twain are not as unrelated as they initially appear.

Travel bursaries
</h2>

<p>
We have a small budget to cover travel costs for speakers and participants. Priority will be given to young researchers, particularly PhD students. We are also able to provide some support for participants with caring or parenting responsibilities. Anyone who requires support should contact <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">Thomas Powell</a> in advance of the meeting.
